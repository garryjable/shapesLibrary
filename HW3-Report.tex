Grader Notes

This is really incomplete, I have some diagrams, a bunch of unit tests and models built out.
No Graphical user interface functionality. Work, other school obligations and my business have taken priority.

I have plans to build the UI with tk. I hope that HW4 will be a continuation of HW3 so that I can continue to work on this.
When I do get this complete I might resubmit this for the partial credit available for late assignments.

I did designs first and then unit tests. I am starting to get the hang of that process and am seeing its worth.
